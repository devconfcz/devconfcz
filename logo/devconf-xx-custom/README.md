# DevConf custom domain (.xx)

These SVG files are never to be used directly. Instead of having text baked into shapes, these files use a live font known as Montserrat, which means you must have the correct font installed on your system before opening these files.

The purpose of these files are to make it easy to customize DevConf to other local regions in the future. For example, if DevConf ever were to take place in Australia, then you could easily open up these files, change .XX to .AU, select the text, and choose "Path → Object to Path" from the menu in Inkscape... then resave the files as `devconf-au-*.svg` (where `*` is the variant).


## Montserrat — the font needed by the SVG 

_Please note that you MUST have Montserrat installed and working before you attempt to open the SVG in Inkscape._

You can install Montserrat by doing one of the following:

1. search for Montserrat in the GNOME Software "app store"

2. running the following in Fedora:
sudo dnf install julietaula-montserrat-fonts

3. ...or by installing the bold and regular OTFs from:
https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat/tree/master/otf
